### Semantic Aphasia

- Recall of words hindered based on class
- Semantic class, syntactic class, etc

### Broca's Aphasia

- Shorter sentences, fewer unique words, could try to measure suprisal, "We also computed “syntactic complexity” of the aphasics and the Control group’s output using the total number of parser actions for each word within each sentence based on the left-corner parsing strategy. This complexity metric is associated with certain aspects of Yngve’s (1960) Depth hypothesis, where the processing effort required for a given word is based on its syntactic structure and a parsing strategy"

### Tourette's Syndome
- Verbal ticks
- Repeated words, syllables
- Taboo words
- Kaya and Tom are doing work of that effect

### Raffaella Paper

- Man had good lexical item look-up but phonological look-up trouble.

### Statistical Significance
- Can just scale up experiments
