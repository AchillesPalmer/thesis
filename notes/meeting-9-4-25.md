# Meeting on 9/4/25

William met with Bob to discuss thesis ideas. If language models can model cognition, to what degree can they be used as models of dementia, autism, and other conditions?

## Components of the Project

- What darts can we throw at the model to try and create these conditions?
    - Should be targeted for each condition studied
    - Adding noise could be used to simulate dementia
    Finding a way to operationalize E/I imbalence could be used to study 
- What specific behaiviors (ideally linguistic behaiviors) can we test for?
    - Something like the McGurk effect

## How to proceed

- Reach out to relevant people at Yale
- Read paper "On Simulating Neural Damage in Connectionist Networks"
Brainstorm darts and tests
